# Purpose
- groups related little coding experiments I've done during Train-of-Thought sessions into a single repo.
- exposes the experiments/lesson outcomes/code snippets in the form of a web app.

Disclaimer: **All code here will be free of private (company) info. No SEEK stuff here. Na-da.**

# T0-D0
- turn this into a PWA?
- use a static site generator like Jekyll or similar generators?
